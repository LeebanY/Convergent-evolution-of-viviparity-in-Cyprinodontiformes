# Convergent-evolution-of-viviparity-in-Cyprinodontiformes
Comparative genomics project examining the role of convergent evolution in the independent origin of viviparity in Cyprinodontiformes. Steps include, aligning, chaining, netting, multiple sequence alignment of public and de-novo genomes, extraction of different genomic features, alignment of orthologs, analysis of convergent evolution at amino acid sites, inferring phylogenetic trees for every sequence, performing analysis to examine evolutionary rates for every protein and finally examining convergent evolution in non-coding regions.
