## Non-coding analyses for Cyprinid convergent evolution of viviparity.

Here are scripts that were used to extract non-coding sequences, infer conserved non-coding sequences by first estimating the subsitution rate in four-fold degenerate sites across the 21 species, and then finally scripts to identify non-coding sequences that experiences accelerated sequence evolution in branches where the transition to viviparity occured.
